### Activities / Challenges

Ponder the following quote from Richard G. Scott:

>"Study the things you do in your discretionary time, that time you are free to control. Do you find that it is centered in those things that are of highest priority and of greatest importance? Or do you unconsciously, consistently fill it with trivia and activities that are not of enduring value nor help you accomplish the purpose for which you came to earth? Think of the long view of life, not just what’s going to happen today or tomorrow. Don’t give up what you most want in life for something you think you want now." ("Jesus Christ, Our Redeemer." April, 1997.)

What things do you do in your free time? How do they compliment your purpose in this life? How do you need to change?
