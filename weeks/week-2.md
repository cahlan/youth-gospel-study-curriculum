# Week 2: The "Tender Mercies of the Lord"

### Introduction

As we learn about and exercise faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, we find that He is eager and ready to help and assist us. Remember, the Atonement isn't just to cover our sins, but also enables us to be better than we otherwise could be.

In 2005, Elder Bednar taught about the "Tender Mercies of the Lord," using a passage from 1 Nephi, where Nephi used the phrase to describe the ways that the Savior blesses us and helps us in his mercy.

We'll study this week more about those tender mercies, how they reflect the character of the Savior, and how we can recognize and access those mercies to bless our lives.

#### Reflection

In your study journal, think about the last week. How have you seen the Lord's tender mercies this week? How about in the past month? The past year?

Remember, Elder Bednar listed the following as possible evidences of tender mercies:
* individualized blessings
* strength
* protection
* assurances
* guidance
* loving-kindnesses
* consolation
* support
* spiritual gifts

### Invitations

* Consider praying to better recognize the tender mercies of the Lord provided in your life
* Ask a parent or someone who has known you since a child how they've observed the hand of the Lord in your life
* As Elder Bednar taught, our desires, faithfulness, and obedience help us to discern the Lord's mercies in our lives. Consider whether you could improve in any of those areas: desire, faith, obedience.

Record any impressions or answers you receive.
