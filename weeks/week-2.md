# Week 2: The "Tender Mercies of the Lord"

## Introduction

As we learn about and exercise faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, we find that He is eager and ready to help and assist us. Remember, the Atonement isn't just to cover our sins, but also enables us to be better than we otherwise could be.

Elder Bednar referenced the "Tender Mercies of the Lord" from a phrase Nephi used to describe the ways that the Savior blesses us and helps us.

We'll study this week more about those mercies, how they reflect the character of the Savior, and how we can recognize and access those mercies to bless our lives.
