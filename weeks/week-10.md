# Week 10: Another Testament of Jesus Christ

### Introduction

On the title page of the Book of Mormon, it is written "to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that JESUS is the CHRIST, the ETERNAL GOD [...]"

This week we'll finish our study program by focusing on how the Book of Mormon teaches us about Christ, how it helps us to come unto Him, and of its role as "Another testament of Jesus Christ."

["The Book of Mormon: What Would Your Life Be Like without It?" Russell M. Nelson, October 2017.](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2017/10/the-book-of-mormon-what-would-your-life-be-like-without-it?lang=eng)

#### Reflection

When teaching one of his sons, Alma spoke about the Liahona and the role it played in leading the children of Lehi to the promised land. He taught that "it is as easy to give heed to the word of Christ, which will point to you a straight course to eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers to give heed to this compass, which would point unto them a straight course to the promised land." ([Alma 37:44](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.44))

In the Alma 33, Alma taught about Moses and the serpent raised in the wilderness ([Alma 33:19-22](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/33.19-22)). Alma taught powerfully about the role of Christ and of our need to look to Him.

> > 20 But few understood the meaning of those things, and this because of the hardness of their hearts. But there were many who were so hardened that they would not look, therefore they perished. Now the reason they would not look is because they did not believe that it would heal them.

> > 21 O my brethren, if ye could be healed by merely casting about your eyes that ye might be healed, would ye not behold quickly, or would ye rather harden your hearts in unbelief, and be slothful, that ye would not cast about your eyes, that ye might perish?

> > 22 If so, wo shall come upon you; but if not so, then cast about your eyes and begin to believe in the Son of God, that he will come to redeem his people, and that he shall suffer and die to atone for their sins; and that he shall rise again from the dead, which shall bring to pass the resurrection, that all men shall stand before him, to be judged at the last and judgment day, according to their works.

Consider yourself in these stories. Would you have been "slothful" to heed the Savior and his words? Or would you have been quick to obey and look to the Savior and live? Are you slow to look to Him now? How can you look more to the Savior? How can you develop more faith in Him and obey his commandments?

Ponder what the study of the scriptures and the gospel has done for you over the past couple of months. How has the study of the scriptures strengthened your testimony of the Savior? How have you felt the Spirit in greature measure in your life?

### Invitations

Ezra Taft Benson taught, 

> "The time is long overdue for a massive flooding of the earth with the Book of Mormon for the many reasons which the Lord has given. In this age of the electronic media and the mass distribution of the printed word, God will hold us accountable if we do not now move the Book of Mormon in a monumental way." (Ezra Taft Benson, "Flooding the Earth with the Book of Mormon," October, 1988.)

Find a copy of the Book of Mormon you could give to someone. Write down your testimony of the Book of Mormon and the Savior Jesus Christ. Consider sharing this book and your testimony with someone who is struggling or who needs encouragement or strengthened testimony. If you can't find someone to give it to today, put the book in a safe place and watch and pray for someone that you might be able to help.

Create a social media post about your testimony of Christ and the Book of Mormon. It doesn't need to be long, but you might consider capturing, perhaps in an image, a video or otherwise, how you feel about the Book of Mormon. 

Record any impressions or answers you receive.
