# Catch Up Week

## July 17 - July 23

### Instructions

This week is a chance for you to catch up on your reading and studying, if you are behind.

Whether or not you are caught up, make a plan this fellowship someone you don't normally associate with. It could be a family member you don't know very well, a less active neighbor, a shy member of your quorum or class, or a sibling that you don't get along with. Plan how you will engage this person and what you will do.

>"For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye?" (Matt. 5:46.)
