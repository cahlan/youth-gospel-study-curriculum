# Week 8: Power and Authority

### Introduction

Look at the definition of **power** from the online Guide to the Scriptures from LDS.org: 

> > The ability to do something. [...] In the scriptures, power is often connected with the power of God or the power of heaven.

We'll study and learn more about the power of God, as manifest through right to act _for_ God is contained in the priesthood, the power God gives to mankind to be able to do cetain things, and how the power of heaven is manifest to us on the earth. 

### Study

Study the scriptures and accounts below. Ask yourself in each situation how the power of God was manifest in the situation given. Did it give someone the ability to do or accomplish something? Was it channeled through a holder of his priesthood in order to act on God's behalf? How was heaven revealed?

#### Reflection

As we've seen, God's power is given to all his children as they ask and qualify for that power in their lives. Consider what in your life might be _keeping_ you from receiving God's power. 

For example, President Nelson, in a BYU devotional focused on music, said the following:

> > Dear brothers and sisters, please fill your minds with worthy sights and sounds. Cultivate your precious gift of the Holy Ghost. Protect it as the priceless gift that it is. Carefully listen for its quiet communication. You will be spiritually stronger if you do. You know the proverb “As [a man] thinketh in his heart, so is he” (Proverbs 23:7). As you control your thoughts, you control your actions. Indeed, worthy music can provide **_power and protection_** for your soul. (May 4, 2008.

What other things, activities, habits or rituals can provide power and protection for your soul?

Is there anything that you are doing (or not doing) that's keeping you from receiving God's power?

### Invitations

Study "For the Strength of the Youth" pamphlet and make a list of areas you feel you can improve in your life. Remember, God's power is accessible to those who ask for it and who live worthily of it. Make a plan as to how you will improve this week.

Record any impressions or answers you receive.
