### Activities / Challenges
Read the following quote:
>"...what does it mean to endure to the end? Endure what, and how? And when is the end? For some people, the term endure calls up images of tar and feathers or other forms of persecution. But few Saints actually face such suffering today. Are we therefore less tested than the Saints of former times? I think not.

The fact is that enduring affliction is only a small part of what “enduring to the end” means. Most frequently, the scriptures use the term endure to mean “to last,” “to continue,” or “to remain,” rather than “to suffer.”  [...] to endure is to continue in the path we adopted at baptism by keeping our commitments to Christ, until the end of our mortal life." ([Stephen E. Robinson, "Enduring to the End," Ensign, October 1993.](https://www.lds.org/ensign/1993/10/enduring-to-the-end?lang=eng))

Write down examples from the scriptures, your family, or your life of enduring to the end.

## June 18: [Catch up]

### Instructions

This day is a chance for you to catch up on your reading and studying, if you are behind.

If you already are caught up, spend some time your journal. Consider that the word "gospel" comes from the Old English and Greek and has the literal meaning of "good news." What is the good news? How is the the Gospel of Jesus Christ good news to you?
