Study Elder Bednar's talk, ["The Tender Mercies of the Lord"](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2005/04/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord?lang=eng)

#### Reflection

In your study journal, think about the last week. How have you seen the Lord's tender mercies this week? How about in the past month? The past year?

Remember, Elder Bednar listed the following as possible evidences of tender mercies:
* individualized blessings
* strength
* protection
* assurances
* guidance
* loving-kindnesses
* consolation
* support
* spiritual gifts

### Invitations

* Consider praying to better recognize the tender mercies of the Lord provided in your life
* Ask a parent or someone who has known you since a child how they've observed the hand of the Lord in your life
* As Elder Bednar taught, our desires, faithfulness, and obedience help us to discern the Lord's mercies in our lives. Consider whether you could improve in any of those areas: desire, faith, obedience.

Record any impressions or answers you receive.
