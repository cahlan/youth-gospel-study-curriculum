# Week 3: The "Journey into the Wilderness"

### Introduction

One of the reasons the Book of Mormon is so important is because it was written for _us_, in _our day_. If this sacred Book was written for us, and if, like Nephi, we are to "liken all scriptures unto us"(1 Nephi 19:23), then there are almost countless things in the Book of Mormon that apply to our lives.

One recurring item we see in the Book of Mormon is the concept of a journey. Consider that in nearly every major migration, a journey is described in detail. This week, we'll try to liken those journeys to our own journey through mortality. Just as the Lord helped, guided, instructed, and ultimately led his people to a promised land, you and I can also be led to a better place, perhaps more spiritually than temporally.

### Study

As you study the following journeys in the Book of Mormon, try to answer the following questions in order to find similarities or differences between the accounts.

1. Who commanded this group of people to take their journey?
2. What did the people leave behind?
3. Was the journey easy?
4. Describe moments where the company doubted or feared their journey would fail.
5. Describe moments where the Lord miraculously assisted or delivered the company.
6. How did the people respond once they arrived at their destination?
7. What changed? How were the people different, or how did they change during their journeys?

#### Other

President Uchtdorf's experiences as a young boy in war-torn Europe and as a refugee are powerful examples of journeys where the Lord's help was critical to his family's safety.

Watch the following videos, and ask yourself the same questions above about President Uchtdorf's journeys:

#### Reflection

In your study journal, think about the journeys of your life. How have you experienced those journeys? Perhaps you have been asked to leave certain things behind in this journey. Maybe you have experienced bumps, "unexpected bends in the road," or pains, sicknesses, or challenges that seemed very difficult to overcome. You might even be experiencing a difficult portion of your journey right now.

Ponder how the Lord has strengthened, helped, guided, blessed, delivered, and led you to better places, whether physically or otherwise. Consider your overall life journey. Where have you come from, and where is your destination? How will the Lord help you to arrive safely? How does He desire that you change along the way?

### Invitations

* Consider applying the princples learned in your study to your mortal journey: obedience, heeding the word of the Lord, trusting in him, allowing him to guide you, and being grateful for the journey as well as hoping for a joyful conclusion. In which of these areas could you improve? Make a plan to do so this week.
* Along our personal journeys, we do not walk alone. Think and pray about someone you know who is experiencing a particularly difficult journey. How might you help them? How can you be an answer to their prayers for help? Pray about what to do, then make a plan to do it.

Read and ponder the Hymn, _Jesus, Savior, Pilot Me_

> > 1. Jesus, Savior, pilot me
> > Over life’s tempestuous sea;
> > Unknown waves before me roll,
> > Hiding rock and treach’rous shoal.
> > Chart and compass came from thee;
> > Jesus, Savior, pilot me.
> > 2. As a mother stills her child,
> > Thou canst hush the ocean wild;
> > Boist’rous waves obey thy will
> > When thou say’st to them, “Be still!”
> > Wondrous Sov’reign of the sea,
> > Jesus, Savior, pilot me.
> > 3. When at last I near the shore,
> > And the fearful breakers roar
> > ’Twixt me and the peaceful rest,
> > Then, while leaning on thy breast,
> > May I hear thee say to me,
> > “Fear not; I will pilot thee.”
