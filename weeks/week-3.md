# Week 3: The "Journey into the Wilderness"

### Introduction

One of the reasons the Book of Mormon is so important is because it was written for _us_, in _our day_. If this sacred Book was written for us, and if, like Nephi, we are to "liken all scriptures unto us"(1 Nephi 19:23), then there are almost countless things in the Book of Mormon that apply to our lives.

One recurring item we see in the Book of Mormon is the concept of a journey. Consider that in nearly every major migration, a journey is described in detail. This week, we'll try to liken those journeys to our own journey through mortality. Just as the Lord helped, guided, instructed, and ultimately led his people to a promised land, you and I can also be led to a better place, perhaps more spiritually than temporally.

### Study

#### Scriptures

As you study the following journeys in the Book of Mormon, try to answer the following questions in order to find similarities or differences between the accounts.

1. Who commanded this group of people to take their journey?
2. What did the people leave behind?
3. Was the journey easy?
4. Describe moments where the company doubted or feared their journey would fail.
5. Describe moments where the Lord miraculously assisted or delivered the company.
6. How did the people respond once they arrived at their destination?

Study Elder Bednar's talk, ["The Tender Mercies of the Lord"](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2005/04/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord?lang=eng)

#### Reflection

In your study journal, think about the last week. How have you seen the Lord's tender mercies this week? How about in the past month? The past year?

Remember, Elder Bednar listed the following as possible evidences of tender mercies:
* individualized blessings
* strength
* protection
* assurances
* guidance
* loving-kindnesses
* consolation
* support
* spiritual gifts

### Invitations

* Consider praying to better recognize the tender mercies of the Lord provided in your life
* Ask a parent or someone who has known you since a child how they've observed the hand of the Lord in your life
* As Elder Bednar taught, our desires, faithfulness, and obedience help us to discern the Lord's mercies in our lives. Consider whether you could improve in any of those areas: desire, faith, obedience.

Record any impressions or answers you receive.
