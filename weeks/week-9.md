# Week 9: Written for Our Day

### Introduction

President Ezra Taft Benson taught, "The Book of Mormon … was written for our day. The Nephites never had the book; neither did the Lamanites of ancient times. It was meant for us." (_Teachings of the Presidents of the Church_: Ezra Taft Benson (2014), 136–45)

Later Gordon B. Hinckley, then an apostle, said this: "In its descriptions of the problems of today’s society, [the Book of Mormon] is as current as the morning newspaper, and much more definitive.” (Ensign, Nov. 1979, p. 8.)

This week we'll study more about why the Book of Mormon was written for our day and how you can apply this sacred book to guide your life.

#### Reflection

When Moroni takes over for his father in finishing the record of his people, he reveals that he has seen our day. Read what he wrote in [Mormon 8:35](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/morm/8.35-37). Was Moroni accurate in his description? Where do you see the things he's describing?

The Book of Mormon clearly describes the fall of the Nephites as a consequence of pride. Although they would repent, they would often grow propserous and allow pride to enter their hearts and corrupt their society. Many have called this progression the "pride cycle." It might be described as follows:

1. Humble repentance
2. Blessed and prospered by the Lord
3. Focus on riches, education, dress, inequality; forgetting of God and despising the poor
4. Loss of the Spirit and the protection of the Lord; calamities ensue
5. Return to humility and repentance (see step 1); repeat

Have you seen this pattern in the Book of Mormon? How many times does it occur?

Have you seen this pattern, even at a smaller degree, in your own life? Which step would you say most accurately describes where you are?

### Invitations

Write a letter to yourself. Describe the things you hope for, the goals you have, and where you'd like to be in 6 months time. Put your letter in an envelope and put it in a place where you'll open it in 6 months from today. Let this be your personal "time capsule." What warnings, advice, encouragement, and guidance will you give to your future self? Record your testimony of the Book of Mormon.

Record any impressions or answers you receive.



### Transcript from video, Special Witness, Elder Stevenson
```
In the Bible, the Apostle Paul described our days as "perilous times." Heavenly Father's generous compensation for living in these perilous times is that we also live in the fulness of times: "the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began."

Here in the Conference Center's Hall of the Prophets, I reflect on how prophets have shown how our loving Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, have provided plain and precious truths to guide, direct, and assist us. As in the days of old, prophets today are called to lead God's children, showing us the way to happiness and eternal life.

I'm grateful for the messages of modern prophets, who've shown me the way to joy and peace.

Brigham Young taught that "the whole world [is] after happiness," but "it is not found in gold and silver, but it is in peace and love." Lorenzo Snow once said: "Do not expect to become perfect at once. If you do, you will be disappointed. Be better today than you were yesterday, and be better tomorrow than you are today."

And President Thomas S. Monson testified of "the great gift which is our Father's plan for us. It is the one perfect path to peace and happiness both here and in the world to come."

I'm also thankful for the messages of ancient prophets found in the holy scriptures. I have a particular love for the glorious and clarifying truths taught in the Book of Mormon. I'm deeply grateful that the Lord has provided us direction through something as tangible and graspable as the Book of Mormon.

This book is one of the blessings of living in our days. The Book of Mormon was written by inspired ancient authors. However, they and the people of their day did not have the benefit of possessing the whole book. We now have easily within our reach the sacred record that prophets, priests, and kings treasured, embraced, and preserved.

This is a first-edition printing of the Book of Mormon. I treasure it for its historic value, but even more, I treasure it for the value of the truths contained within. The plain and precious teachings found in the Book of Mormon strengthen my faith in the existence of God and have given me a better, more full understanding of the miracle of our Heavenly Father's plan and the Atonement of Jesus Christ.

As another testament of Jesus Christ, the Book of Mormon gives all of God's children a personal opportunity to expand their knowledge of the Savior's Atonement. Within the book's pages, we discover the infinite love and incomprehensible grace of Jesus Christ, which extends to all mankind. As I strive to follow these plain and precious truths, my joy is expanded, my understanding increases, and the answers I seek to life's challenges are found.

I am a special witness of Jesus Christ. That witness began as a seed planted through the teachings of ancient and modern prophets. It has grown to a firm testimony of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ, with the Book of Mormon as tangible evidence of it. It has brought me profound joy and peace and a true relationship with Jesus Christ.

I know He lives and loves us. He is our Savior and Redeemer. I witness this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
