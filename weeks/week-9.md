# Week 9: Written for Our Day

### Introduction

President Ezra Taft Benson taught, "The Book of Mormon … was written for our day. The Nephites never had the book; neither did the Lamanites of ancient times. It was meant for us." (_Teachings of the Presidents of the Church_: Ezra Taft Benson (2014), 136–45)

Later Gordon B. Hinckley, then an apostle, said this: "In its descriptions of the problems of today’s society, [the Book of Mormon] is as current as the morning newspaper, and much more definitive.” (Ensign, Nov. 1979, p. 8.)

This week we'll study more about why the Book of Mormon was written for our day and how you can apply this sacred book to guide your life.

#### Other

Study Elder Holland's talk, ["Safety for the Soul."](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/10/safety-for-the-soul) What were your thoughts, feelings, and impressions as you studied this talk?

#### Reflection

When Moroni takes over for his father in finishing the record of his people, he reveals that he has seen our day. Read what he wrote in [Mormon 8:35](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/morm/8.35-37). Was Moroni accurate in his description? Where do you see the things he's describing?

The Book of Mormon clearly describes the fall of the Nephites as a consequence of pride. Although they would repent, they would often grow propserous and allow pride to enter their hearts and corrupt their society. Many have called this progression the "pride cycle." It might be described as follows:
1. Humble repentance
2. Blessed and prospered by the Lord
3. Focus on riches, education, dress, inequality; forgetting of God and despising the poor
4. Loss of the Spirit and the protection of the Lord; calamities ensue
5. Return to humility and repentance (see step 1); repeat

Have you seen this pattern in the Book of Mormon? How many times does it occur?

Have you seen this pattern, even at a smaller degree, in your own life? Which step would you say most accurately describes where you are?
