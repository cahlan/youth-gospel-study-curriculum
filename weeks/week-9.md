# Week 9: Written for Our Day

### Introduction

President Ezra Taft Benson taught, "The Book of Mormon … was written for our day. The Nephites never had the book; neither did the Lamanites of ancient times. It was meant for us." (_Teachings of the Presidents of the Church_: Ezra Taft Benson (2014), 136–45)

Later Gordon B. Hinckley, then an apostle, said this: "In its descriptions of the problems of today’s society, [the Book of Mormon] is as current as the morning newspaper, and much more definitive.” (Ensign, Nov. 1979, p. 8.)

This week we'll study more about why the Book of Mormon was written for our day and how you can apply this sacred book to guide your life.
