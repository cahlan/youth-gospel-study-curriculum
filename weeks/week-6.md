# Week 6: Catch-up Week

### Instructions

Use this week to catch up on previous weeks you've missed or fell behind on. Regardless of if you are caught up, be sure to study the Book of Mormon every day this week. Record thoughts, feelings, impressions and promptings as you do so. If the Spirit prompts you to do something, make a plan to do it and carry it out.
