# Catch Up Week

## July 3 - July 8

### Instructions

This week is a chance for you to catch up on your reading and studying, if you are behind.

Whether or not you are caught up, make a plan this week to serve those around you. Include in your plan parents, siblings, friends or peers, and quorum or class members. How can you help those around you feel the love Heavenly Father has for them? What can you do to show them your love and appreciation and concern for them?

As you plan your service, consider the following quote from Spencer W. Kimball:

>"God does notice us, and he watches over us. But it is usually through another person that he meets our needs. Therefore, it is vital that we serve each other." (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Spencer W. Kimball (2006), 82.)
