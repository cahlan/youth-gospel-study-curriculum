# Week 1: The Power of Deliverance

### Introduction

One of the principal roles of Jesus Christ is that of Savior. Ancient Israel was constantly reminded of Jehovah's ability to rescue them from precarious situations, whether it be from famine, war, or opression. Nephi repeatedly taught that those who trust in the Lord can depend on Him for deliverance.

The Book of Mormon contains multiple powerful examples of the Savior's deliverance from physical and spiritual captivity.

Let's study more how the Savior and his blessings of deliverance have blessed those whose stories are in the Book of Mormon and understand how those mercies apply to you in your life.

### Study

As you study the scriptures below, record in your study journal how the concepts of mercy, deliverance, rescue, succor, hearing and answering prayers, and longsuffering are shown. Ask yourself these questions:

* What can I learn about how the Savior saves?
* What is it about the nature of Jesus Christ that makes Him eager to save?
* How have I, or how might I need deliverance or saving?

Study [Helaman 12](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/12). How does the Lord's deliverance affect the children of men? Does the natural man recognize or remember his deliverance? How does the Lord reveal himself to man through deliverance?

### Invitations

Besides the promptings and learnings you receive as you study, write down in your journal experiences you recall of being delivered by God. Ponder and record what those experiences taught you, and how your faith and trust in the Lord was affected as a result.

Read and ponder the Hymn, _Redeemer of Israel_

> > 1. Redeemer of Israel,
> > Our only delight,
> > On whom for a blessing we call,
> > Our shadow by day
> > And our pillar by night,
> > Our King, our Deliv’rer, our all!
> > 2. We know he is coming
> > To gather his sheep
> > And lead them to Zion in love,
> > For why in the valley
> > Of death should they weep
> > Or in the lone wilderness rove?
> > 3. How long we have wandered
> > As strangers in sin
> > And cried in the desert for thee!
> > Our foes have rejoiced
> > When our sorrows they’ve seen,
> > But Israel will shortly be free.
> > 4. As children of Zion,
> > Good tidings for us.
> > The tokens already appear.
> > Fear not, and be just,
> > For the kingdom is ours.
> > The hour of redemption is near.
> > 5. Restore, my dear Savior,
> > The light of thy face;
> > Thy soul-cheering comfort impart;
> > And let the sweet longing
> > For thy holy place
> > Bring hope to my desolate heart.
> > 6. He looks! and ten thousands
> > Of angels rejoice,
> > And myriads wait for his word;
> > He speaks! and eternity,
> > Filled with his voice,
> > Re-echoes the praise of the Lord.

Ask yourself these questions, and record your answers:
* Ancient Israel wandered in the wilderness as they were tested and purified from sin. Have there been times in your life when you've wandered in sin? Have you "cried" to the Lord from your own personal desert?
* Have you felt the "hope to [your] desolate heart" mentioned in verse 5? Have you felt the figurative light of the Savior's face?
* Do *you* know that He is coming, not only to gather Israel, but to gather _you_, personally? That He will "lead [you] to Zion in love?"

Record your testimony and what you've learned about the Savior, the Redeemer of Israsel.
