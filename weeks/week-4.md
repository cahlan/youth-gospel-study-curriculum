# Week 3: Remember

### Introduction

The word "remember" occurs at least 157 times in the Book of Mormon, almost as many occurrences as the Old Testament. This week we'll study why remembering is so important, and what it is that we need to remember.

### Study

Study the ways "remember" is used in the following scriptures.

#### Scriptures

* Lehi's Family, 1 Nephi [1](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1)-[7](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/7), [16](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16)-[18](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18)

#### Other




#### Reflection

Reflect on the things the Lord and his prophets consistently plead with the people to remember:
* Covenants and Promises of the Lord
* Warnings
* The words of "fathers" or ancestors
* The Lord's dealings with "fathers" or ancestors
* Commandments and penalties
* Our dependence on God
* The mercy of God
* 

Do we need help remembering? Who helps us remember?

### Invitations

* Ponder the Sacrament hymn

Read a talk

Read and ponder the Hymn, _Jesus, Savior, Pilot Me_

> > 1. Jesus, Savior, pilot me
> > Over life’s tempestuous sea;
> > Unknown waves before me roll,
> > Hiding rock and treach’rous shoal.
> > Chart and compass came from thee;
> > Jesus, Savior, pilot me.
> > 2. As a mother stills her child,
> > Thou canst hush the ocean wild;
> > Boist’rous waves obey thy will
> > When thou say’st to them, “Be still!”
> > Wondrous Sov’reign of the sea,
> > Jesus, Savior, pilot me.
> > 3. When at last I near the shore,
> > And the fearful breakers roar
> > ’Twixt me and the peaceful rest,
> > Then, while leaning on thy breast,
> > May I hear thee say to me,
> > “Fear not; I will pilot thee.”
