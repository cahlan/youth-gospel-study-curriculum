# Week 4: Remember

### Introduction

The word "remember" occurs at least 157 times in the Book of Mormon, almost as many occurrences as the Old Testament. This week we'll study why remembering is so important, and what it is that we need to remember.

### Study

Study the ways "remember" is used in the following scriptures. Consider that the command _remember_ can be used in different ways. Look up the [definition of the word remember](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/remember) and write down the usages you find so they can accompany your scripture study. You might add further usages you find as you study.

#### Scriptures

* Search LDS.org for all instances of "remember" in the Book of Mormon. Here's a [direct link](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/search?lang=eng&query=remember&testament=bofm) to the search.
* Also (or if you don't have internet access), look up "Remember" in the topical guide ([link](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/tg/remember?lang=eng))

#### Other

Study Elder Bednar's talk, "Exceeding Great and Precious Promises," and write down what Elder Bednar teaches about how to remember the "essential spiritual priorities."


#### Reflection

Reflect on the things the Lord and his prophets consistently plead with the people to remember:
* Covenants and Promises of the Lord
* Warnings
* The words of "fathers" or ancestors
* The Lord's dealings with "fathers" or ancestors
* Commandments and penalties
* Our dependence on God
* The mercy of God

What keeps us you from remembering? What could you do better to remember the "spiritual priorities" and things you read in the scriptures?

Do we need help remembering? Who helps us remember? Find scriptures that explain _how_ and _who_ helps us to remember.

### Invitations

* Study the sacrament prayers. If you haven't already, pray about this portion of your study. The sacrament prayers are sacred. They aren't just scripture, they are a part of an ordinance.

#### Prayer on the Bread
> > O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this bread to the souls of all those who partake of it, that they may eat in remembrance of the body of thy Son, and witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they are willing to take upon them the name of thy Son, and always remember him and keep his commandments which he has given them; that they may always have his Spirit to be with them. Amen.

#### Prayer on the Water
> > O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this wine to the souls of all those who drink of it, that they may do it in remembrance of the blood of thy Son, which was shed for them; that they may witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they do always remember him, that they may have his Spirit to be with them. Amen.

Ponder on the way the Lord uses the term "remember" here. What is He asking you to remember? How do we _always_ remember him? What is the result of remembering him _always_?

For help, you could reference and study Elder Gong's talk, ["Always Remember Him."](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2016/04/always-remember-him?lang=eng)
