# The Commandments

## June 19: Obedience

### Reflection Questions
Why is obedience important? Why should I be obedient?

### Study

### Activities / Challenges
Read the following quote by President Monson:

>“God’s commandments are not given to frustrate us or to become obstacles to our happiness. Just the opposite is true. He who created us and who loves us perfectly knows just how we need to live our lives in order to obtain the greatest happiness possible. He has provided us with guidelines which, if we follow them, will see us safely through this often treacherous mortal journey. We remember the words of the familiar hymn: ‘Keep the commandments! In this there is safety; in this there is peace’ [see “Keep the Commandments,” Hymns, no. 303].”

Contrast President Monson's message with what the world teachese us. How is obedience viewed by the world?
