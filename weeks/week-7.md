# Week 7: Beware of Pride

### Introduction

The sin of pride led to the downfall of the Nephites. Since the Book of Mormon was written for our day, we would do well to understand the pitfalls of pride, its effects on us, and how to avoid this sin in our lives.

### Study

As you study the following scriptures, make a list of the ways that pride manifests itself. List the "symptoms" of this spiritual sickness. For example, fine clothing, envyings, and so on.

#### Other

Study Ezra Taft Benson's landmark address, ["Beware of Pride"](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1989/04/beware-of-pride?lang=eng). In it, President Benson describes what is at the heart of pride, the many faces and consequences of pride, and the importance of God's people avoiding this cardinal sin.

Make notes about which aspects of pride you notice in others, and which you notice in yourself. How can we overcome pride?

#### Reflection

Mormon lamented that man is "quick to be lifted up in pride."[(Helaman 12:5)](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/12.5) Why are we quick to be prideful?

Consider your relationships with others around you: perhaps family members, friends, church members or others. Has pride affected any of those relationships? How would your humility help repair a friendship or help someone else?

Now, consider your relationship with God. How is pride getting in the way of your relationship with him? How do you know?

Mormon told his son Moroni, "Behold, the pride of this nation [...] hath proven their destruction."[(Moroni 8:27)](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/8.27). If the sin of pride can cause the entire destruction of a civilization, can it cause the downfall of a city? How about a community? A school? A neighborhood? A family? Can it cause your destruction?

### Invitations

The opposite of pride is humility. Whereas the proud boast in their own strength and resist God's commandments and counsel, the humble accept his will and strive to do all they can to become more like him.

Prayerfully read and ponder [Mosiah 3:19](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19). King Benjamin captures in a single verse the battle of our mortal lives in becoming humble and more like the Savior. How can you become more like a child? Which attributes of those listed by King Benjamin could you develop more fully?

Consider the hymn, "Be Thou Humble."

> > 1. Be thou humble in thy weakness, and the Lord thy God shall lead thee,
Shall lead thee by the hand and give thee answer to thy prayers.
Be thou humble in thy pleading, and the Lord thy God shall bless thee,
Shall bless thee with a sweet and calm assurance that he cares.
> > 2. Be thou humble in thy calling, and the Lord thy God shall teach thee
To serve his children gladly with a pure and gentle love.
Be thou humble in thy longing, and the Lord thy God shall take thee,
Shall take thee home at last to ever dwell with him above.

Make a list of the blessings received by those who are humble. Do you desire these blessings?

This week, think about an experience when you relied on God for help. Think about a time when you were wrong about someone. Share these experiences with a loved one. 

Record any impressions or answers you receive.
