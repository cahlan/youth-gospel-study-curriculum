#### Other

Study Ezra Taft Benson's landmark address, ["Beware of Pride"](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1989/04/beware-of-pride?lang=eng). In it, President Benson describes what is at the heart of pride, the many faces and consequences of pride, and the importance of God's people avoiding this cardinal sin.

Make notes about which aspects of pride you notice in others, and which you notice in yourself. How can we overcome pride?

#### Reflection

Consider your relationships with others around you: perhaps family members, friends, church members or others. Has pride affected any of those relationships? How would your humility help repair a friendship or help someone else?

Now, consider your relationship with God. How is pride getting in the way of your relationship with him? How do you know?

### Invitations

The opposite of pride is humility. Whereas the proud boast in their own strength and resist God's commandments and counsel, the humble accept his will and strive to do all they can to become more like him.

Prayerfully read and ponder [Mosiah 3:19](). King Benjamin captures in a single verse the battle of our mortal lives in becoming humble and more like the Savior. How can you become more like a child? Which attributes of those listed by King Benjamin could you develop more fully?

Consider the hymn, "Be Thou Humble."

> > 1. Be thou humble in thy weakness, and the Lord thy God shall lead thee,
Shall lead thee by the hand and give thee answer to thy prayers.
Be thou humble in thy pleading, and the Lord thy God shall bless thee,
Shall bless thee with a sweet and calm assurance that he cares.
2. Be thou humble in thy calling, and the Lord thy God shall teach thee
To serve his children gladly with a pure and gentle love.
Be thou humble in thy longing, and the Lord thy God shall take thee,
Shall take thee home at last to ever dwell with him above.

Make a list of the blessings received by those who are humble. Do you desire these blessings? How will you become more humble?

Record any impressions or answers you receive.
