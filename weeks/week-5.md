# Week 5: "Protect this People"

### Introduction

Lord promises to his faithful saints is that He will protect them. This week we'll discuss what the Lord's protection looks like, how we can assure ourselves of his protection, and how we, with the Lord's help, can protect ourselves and our loved ones from physical and spiritual danger.

### Study

Study the accounts below of the Lord protecting his people. 

#### Scriptures

##### Nephi and his brothers protected while retrieving the brass plates

* [1 Nephi 3:10-29](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.10-29); [4](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4); [5:5-8](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/5.5-8)

In the experience, how did the Lord protect Nephi and his brothers? How did He help them succeed in spite of what was a very difficult undertaking? Why didn't He make it easy for them?

##### Nephi is protected from starvation and from his brothers

* [1 Nephi 7:16-21](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/7.16-21)
* [1 Nephi 16:18-23, 30-31](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16.18-23,30-31)
* [1 Nephi 16:35-39](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16.35-39)
* [1 Nephi 17:48-55](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.48-55)
* [1 Nephi 18:8-22](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18.8-22)


#### Other

Study Elder Bednar's talk, "Exceeding Great and Precious Promises," and write down what Elder Bednar teaches about how to remember the "essential spiritual priorities."

Some other talks you could study,
* President Eyring, ["O Remember, Remember"](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember?lang=eng)

#### Reflection

Reflect on the things the Lord and his prophets consistently plead with the people to remember:
* Covenants and Promises of the Lord
* Warnings
* The words of "fathers" or ancestors
* The Lord's dealings with "fathers" or ancestors
* Commandments and penalties
* Our dependence on God
* The mercy of God

What keeps us you from remembering? What could you do better to remember the "spiritual priorities" and things you read in the scriptures?

Do we need help remembering? Who helps us remember? Find scriptures that explain _how_ and _who_ helps us to remember.

### Invitations

* This Sunday, pay special attention to the sacrament prayers. If you haven't already, pray about and study these prayers. The sacrament prayers are sacred. They aren't just scripture, they are a part of an ordinance.

#### Prayer on the Bread
> > O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this bread to the souls of all those who partake of it, that they may eat in remembrance of the body of thy Son, and witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they are willing to take upon them the name of thy Son, and always remember him and keep his commandments which he has given them; that they may always have his Spirit to be with them. Amen.

#### Prayer on the Water
> > O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this wine to the souls of all those who drink of it, that they may do it in remembrance of the blood of thy Son, which was shed for them; that they may witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they do always remember him, that they may have his Spirit to be with them. Amen.

Ponder on the way the Lord uses the term "remember" here. What is He asking you to remember? How do we _always_ remember him? What is the result of remembering him _always_? Write down your thoughts. (For help, you could reference and study Elder Gong's talk, ["Always Remember Him."](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2016/04/always-remember-him?lang=eng))

Take this week and write down, each day, how you saw the Lord's hand in your life. Seek to _recognize_ and _remember_ how the Lord is influencing, blessing, and guiding your life. Record these impressions. This is what President Eyring said about trying this same experience:

> > I wrote down a few lines every day for years. I never missed a day no matter how tired I was or how early I would have to start the next day. Before I would write, I would ponder this question: “Have I seen the hand of God reaching out to touch us or our children or our family today?” As I kept at it, something began to happen. As I would cast my mind over the day, I would see evidence of what God had done for one of us that I had not recognized in the busy moments of the day. As that happened, and it happened often, I realized that trying to remember had allowed God to show me what He had done.

> > More than gratitude began to grow in my heart. Testimony grew. I became ever more certain that our Heavenly Father hears and answers prayers. I felt more gratitude for the softening and refining that come because of the Atonement of the Savior Jesus Christ. And I grew more confident that the Holy Ghost can bring all things to our remembrance—even things we did not notice or pay attention to when they happened.
[Henry B. Eyring, "O Rememeber, Remember," October, 2007.](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember?lang=eng)

Record any impressions or answers you receive.
