# Week 5: "Protect this People"

### Introduction

Lord promises to his faithful saints is that He will protect them. This week we'll discuss what the Lord's protection looks like, how we can assure ourselves of his protection, and how we, with the Lord's help, can protect ourselves and our loved ones from physical and spiritual danger.

### Study

Study the accounts below of the Lord protecting his people. 

#### Scriptures

##### Nephi and his brothers protected while retrieving the brass plates

* [1 Nephi 3:10-29](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.10-29); [4](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4); [5:5-8](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/5.5-8)

In the experience, how did the Lord protect Nephi and his brothers? How did He help them succeed in spite of what was a very difficult undertaking? Why didn't He make it easy for them?

##### Nephi is protected from starvation and from his brothers

* [1 Nephi 7:16-21](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/7.16-21)

#### Reflection

Reflect on this line from a familiar hymn: 

##### "Keep the commandments. In this there is safety and peace."

Why does keeping the commandments bring safety? Why does keeping the commandments bring peace?"



Do we need help remembering? Who helps us remember? Find scriptures that explain _how_ and _who_ helps us to remember.

> > I wrote down a few lines every day for years. I never missed a day no matter how tired I was or how early I would have to start the next day. Before I would write, I would ponder this question: “Have I seen the hand of God reaching out to touch us or our children or our family today?” As I kept at it, something began to happen. As I would cast my mind over the day, I would see evidence of what God had done for one of us that I had not recognized in the busy moments of the day. As that happened, and it happened often, I realized that trying to remember had allowed God to show me what He had done.

> > More than gratitude began to grow in my heart. Testimony grew. I became ever more certain that our Heavenly Father hears and answers prayers. I felt more gratitude for the softening and refining that come because of the Atonement of the Savior Jesus Christ. And I grew more confident that the Holy Ghost can bring all things to our remembrance—even things we did not notice or pay attention to when they happened.
