# Week 5: "Protect this People"

### Introduction

Lord promises to his faithful saints is that He will protect them. This week we'll discuss what the Lord's protection looks like, how we can assure ourselves of his protection, and how we, with the Lord's help, can protect ourselves and our loved ones from physical and spiritual danger.

### Study

Study the accounts below of the Lord protecting his people. 

#### Scriptures

##### Nephi and his brothers protected while retrieving the brass plates

* [1 Nephi 3:10-29](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.10-29); [4](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4); [5:5-8](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/5.5-8)

In the experience, how did the Lord protect Nephi and his brothers? How did He help them succeed in spite of what was a very difficult undertaking? Why didn't He make it easy for them?

##### Nephi is protected from starvation and from his brothers

What dangers faced Nephi and his family during their journey? Why didn't the Lord remove those dangers automatically and make their way easier? What were the consequences of disobedience?

* [1 Nephi 7:16-21](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/7.16-21)
* [1 Nephi 16:18-23, 30-31](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16.18-23,30-31)
* [1 Nephi 16:35-39](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16.35-39)
* [1 Nephi 17:48-55](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.48-55)
* [1 Nephi 18:8-22](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18.8-22)

#### The Lord protects the people of Ammon

How did the Lord protect the Anti-Lehi-Nephites? 

* [Alma 27:1-15](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/27.1-15)

#### Moroni is inspired to create the Title of Liberty

What were the conditions upon which the Nephites would be able to maintain their liberty? Who or what threatened them?

* [Alma 46:1-18](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/46.1-18)

#### The Nephites are protected from the siege of the Gadianton Robbers

How did the Lord help the Nephites to face so great a threat? How did He inspire and give courage to the hearts of the Nephites who faced so terrible a foe?

* [3 Nephi 4](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/4)

#### Other

Study the talk, ["Safety for the Soul,"](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/10/safety-for-the-soul?lang=eng) from Elder Holland.

#### Reflection

Reflect on this line from a familiar hymn: 

##### "Keep the commandments. In this there is safety and peace."

Now answer these questions:

* Why does keeping the commandments bring safety? Safety from what, exactly?
* Why does keeping the commandments bring peace?" Peace as opposed to what, exactly?

Create a list of protections the Lord has given us in our day. Remember, some of them may be things we readily see or observe, others may be things passed down to us by others, and yet others might be things that are eternal in nature. List of the varying kinds of protections that the Lord has provided for you.

### Invitations

Think about the dangers you face in your life today. What calamities are there that you might encounter? Are there temporal or spiritual dangers that you've seen, perhaps even affecting or hurting others?

How will you avoid these dangers? What do you need to do this week to ensure that you and those you love are safe?

In the April 2018 General Conference, President Nelson's said this:

> > "[In] coming days, it will not be possible to survive spiritually without the guiding, directing, comforting, and constant influence of the Holy Ghost.

My beloved brothers and sisters, I plead with you to increase your spiritual capacity to receive revelation. Let this Easter Sunday be a defining moment in your life. Choose to do the spiritual work required to enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost and hear the voice of the Spirit more frequently and more clearly."

What "spiritual work" is President Nelson talking about? How can you hear the voice of the Spirit more frequently and more clearly?
